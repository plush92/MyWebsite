# "On-chain data"

- refers to data that is recorded directly on the blockchain itself.
- Since a blockchain is a decentralized, public ledger of all transactions for a given cryptocurrency, it captures various types of data that can be analyzed to understand the activity, security, and usage of a network.
- On-chain data is especially valuable for understanding the behavior of a cryptocurrency beyond just price movements.

## Types of On-Chain Data

`Transaction Volume`

- Measures the total value of transactions over a given time period.
- High transaction volume can indicate active usage and interest in a cryptocurrency.

`Active Addresses`

- The number of unique addresses participating in transactions within a certain period (e.g., daily or monthly).
- It shows the level of engagement and can be a good proxy for user activity on the network.

`New Addresses`

- The count of newly created addresses.
- A growing number of new addresses can indicate increased adoption or interest in the cryptocurrency.

`Hash Rate (Proof-of-Work Chains)`

- The total computational power used to mine and process transactions.
- Higher hash rates signify a more secure and active network, making it harder to perform attacks.

`Supply Metrics`

- `Circulating Supply`: The total amount of coins that are currently in circulation.
- `Supply Distribution`: The breakdown of coin ownership across different groups of holders, such as small holders vs. "whales" (large holders).
- `Dormant Coins`: Coins that haven’t moved in a long time, often indicating long-term holders.

`Whale Activity`

- Tracks large transactions, especially from large holders (whales).
- For example, a large transfer from a private wallet to an exchange might indicate potential selling pressure.

`Network Fees`

- The average transaction fee paid by users to miners or validators.
- Rising fees can signal network congestion or increased demand for transactions on the network.

`Staking and Total Value Locked (TVL) (Proof-of-Stake and DeFi)`

- For proof-of-stake chains, staking metrics show the amount of cryptocurrency locked by validators.
- For DeFi, TVL indicates the total assets locked in smart contracts, often in lending or liquidity pools, showing the health and adoption of decentralized finance.

## Why On-Chain Data is Useful

- On-chain data provides insights into the fundamental health and user activity of a blockchain network. 
- It allows crypto analysts and investors to:
  - Gauge the adoption and growth of a network.
  - Assess security (e.g., through hash rate or staking levels).
  - Monitor whale activity to identify potential market-moving transactions.
  - Analyze user engagement (e.g., through active addresses or transaction count).

## Where to Get On-Chain Data

- Several platforms offer on-chain data through APIs and dashboards, including:
  - `Glassnode:` Known for on-chain metrics for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major coins.
  - `IntoTheBlock:` Provides various blockchain and market analytics.
  - `CryptoQuant:` Focuses on metrics like exchange inflows, outflows, and miner activity.
  - `Etherscan (Ethereum-specific):` Offers an API for tracking transactions, tokens, and contract activity on the Ethereum blockchain.

By using on-chain data, you can provide your dashboard’s users with insights beyond price trends, adding depth to the analysis by showing real blockchain activity.

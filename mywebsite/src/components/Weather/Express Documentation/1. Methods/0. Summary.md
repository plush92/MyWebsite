# express.json([options])
`Purpose`: Middleware for parsing JSON request bodies.
`How it works`: It processes incoming requests with Content-Type: application/json and adds the parsed JSON data to req.body.
`Usage`: This is typically used in APIs where JSON is the standard data format for sending and receiving information.
`Example`:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.body);  // req.body now contains parsed JSON data
});
`Options`: You can customize it using options like limit (to control the max body size) and strict (to allow or disallow non-objects and non-arrays).

# express.static(root, [options])
`Purpose`: Serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
`How it works`: This middleware exposes a directory of static files so they can be directly accessed via URLs.
`Usage`: Commonly used for serving assets like CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images in a web app.
`Example`:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Now files like '/public/style.css' are available at '/style.css'
`Options`: You can control things like caching (maxAge), case sensitivity, and whether to allow directory browsing.

# express.Router([options])
`Purpose`: Creates modular, mountable route handlers. This helps organize your routes into separate files or sections of your app.
`How it works`: express.Router() works like a mini Express app, allowing you to define routes and middleware. You can then attach it to your main app.
`Usage`: Useful for structuring larger applications by grouping related routes.
`Example`:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define routes in the router
router.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User page');
});

// Use the router in the main app
const app = express();
app.use('/api', router);  // Routes are now mounted at '/api'
`Options`: You can pass options such as caseSensitive (for case-sensitive routing) or strict (for strict matching of route paths).

# express.urlencoded([options])
`Purpose`: Middleware for parsing URL-encoded data (typically form data from POST requests).
`How it works`: It parses incoming requests with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and adds the parsed data to req.body.
`Usage`: Used when handling form submissions from web pages, where data is encoded in URL-like key-value pairs.
`Example`:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Parse URL-encoded bodies (like form submissions)
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.body);  // req.body contains parsed form data
});
`Options`:
`extended`: If true, allows for richer data types (arrays, objects) in URL-encoded form data. If false, only allows simple key-value pairs.

Each of these methods adds essential functionality to Express apps, allowing you to handle JSON data, serve static files, structure routes, and parse form data effectively.

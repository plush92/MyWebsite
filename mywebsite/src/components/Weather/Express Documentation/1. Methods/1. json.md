# express() Function
`Creates an Express app`: The express() function initializes a new Express application. It is a top-level function provided by the express module.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

# express.json([options]) 
## Middleware
`Purpose`: This built-in middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads, replacing the need for body-parser.
`How it works`: 
    It only processes requests with Content-Type: application/json (or other matching types specified by options) and populates the parsed data on req.body.
    If there's no matching content type, no body, or an error, req.body will be an empty object ({}).
`Important`: Since req.body is based on user input, you must validate its properties before using them to avoid errors (e.g., req.body.foo.toString() could fail if foo is missing or not a string).

## Options for express.json()
`inflate`: Controls whether compressed (gzip/deflate) request bodies are automatically handled. Default: true.
`limit`: Sets the maximum size of the request body. It can be a number (in bytes) or a string (e.g., "100kb"). Default: "100kb".
`reviver`: A function passed to JSON.parse to customize parsing, similar to the second argument of JSON.parse(). Default: null.
`strict`: If true, only arrays and objects are accepted. If false, anything that JSON.parse accepts is allowed. Default: true.
`type`: Specifies which content types are parsed. It can be a string (e.g., "application/json"), an array of strings, or a function. Default: "application/json".
`verify`: A function called during parsing that can inspect or modify the raw body before it's processed. You can throw an error to abort parsing. `Default`: undefined.

This middleware is essential for handling JSON payloads in APIs, and it offers customization through the options for more control over parsing.

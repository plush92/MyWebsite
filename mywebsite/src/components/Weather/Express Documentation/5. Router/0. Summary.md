# Router Methods

`router.all(path, callback)`: Handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for a specific route.
`router.METHOD(path, callback)`: Defines a route for a specific HTTP method (e.g., router.get, router.post).
`router.param(name, callback)`: Adds middleware to handle route parameters (e.g., :id) for any matching route.
`router.route(path)`: Creates a chainable route handler for a specific path, allowing different HTTP methods to be attached (e.g., GET, POST).
`router.use([path], middleware)`: Mounts middleware or sub-routers on the router, optionally specifying a path.

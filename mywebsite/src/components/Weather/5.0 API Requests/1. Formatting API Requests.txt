How to format:
We need to understand endpoints, path parameters, and query parameters

Endpoints:
    specific paths on an API server.
    For example, /random or /filter (examples in the "Bored" API). They redirect to different functions or resources
Query Parameters:
    Added after the question mark in the URL to filter or modify the request further.
    They come in key-value pairs, such as 'type=social' and 'participants=2', used to refine search results

Example:
    bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint?query=value&query2=value&query3=value

Path Parameters:
    Used to identify a specific resource.
    For example:
        /activity/5914292 usese '5914292' as a path parameter to fetch a specific identify
        /users/{userId} (the userID in this case would be the path parameter)
    Dynamic values: Path parameters are placeholders that are replaced with actual values to specify a unique resource
    Uniqueness: Each path parameter typically corresponds to a unique identifier or key that distinguishes one resource from another
    Required in URL: they are not optional!

What are APIs?
    Application programming interface. It allows your application to communicate with other applications and retrieve data from them
    More specifically, it's a set of rules and protocols defining how software components interact

Common ways they're used:
    Amazon bookstore:
        Searching:
            when you search for a book on Amazon, the website communicates with various databases info about available books, prices, reviews and More
            APIs enable these communications by defining how the frontend (user interface) interacts with the backend (databases and servers)
        Payment:
            when you pay, Amazon uses payment gateway APIs like Paypal, Stripe, or its own
            these APIs handle communication between Amazon's servers and the financial institutions to authorize and complete the payment securely
        Shipping/Inventory
            Amazon uses APIs to track inventory levels and update the status of orders in real time
            Shipping APIs (from UPS, Fedex, etc) provide tracking info and update customers on the delivery status
    
    Netflix:
        Content delivery:
            APIs manage the retrieval and delivery of the video content on the servers to your device
        User recommendations
            It uses complex algorithms that rely on APIs to fetch user data to geneate personalized suggestions
        Authentication and security
            logging into netflix, euthentication APIs verify your credentials and manage user sessions
            security APIs ensure that your personal data and payment info are protected
    
    General ways APIs are used:
        Integration - different services can communicate and interact with each other
        Real time updates
        Automation
        Scalability: APIs allow the platforms to operate more efficiently, allowing better Scalability
    
API frameworks:
    REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC. RESTful APIs
    We are learning RESTful

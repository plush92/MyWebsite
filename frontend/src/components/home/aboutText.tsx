      <p>
        I began my career in finance, completing degrees at the University of Central Florida (2015) and the University of West Florida (MBA, Business Analytics, 2021), and passed exams for the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification in December 2022.
        However, I soon discovered a passion for automation and efficiency, using Python to simplify tedious accounting tasks. That realization sparked my transition into programming, where I now thrive on solving problems and making workflows more intuitive.

      <p>
        I self-taught Python and its frameworks, including REST API, FastAPI, and Flask, expanding into JavaScript, React, Material UI, and SQL. I also began learning Java, continually pushing myself to explore new technologies and broaden my skill set. My projects range from web development to interactive experiences, always with a focus on practical solutions that enhance user satisfaction and go beyond expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that technology should work for people, not the other way around. Whether designing interfaces, building automation tools, or developing interactive experiences, my goal is to create seamless, user-centric solutions that transform the way people work and interact.

# Blog page

`Ideas for the blog`
Track progress thru github calendar/projects
Update thoughts/feelings about project + working thru things and learning & philosophy
Include personality type (introspective pattern seeking, emotional) and describe how you set up everything to be the best you can be
Date, description. Scale 1-5 (frown to smile) for how you were feeling before you started, and then again after you're done
In between, have prompts to direct your writings to be more organized/centered/focused

# üåü High-Impact Additions
1. `Reactions or Like System` Let readers give quick feedback without leaving a comment. Could just be üëç / ‚ù§Ô∏è / üò≤, tied to each post.
2. `Highlight Popular Posts` Either by views (if you‚Äôre tracking them) or likes/comments. Display in a sidebar or ‚ÄúTop Posts‚Äù section.
3. `Draft Autosave + Recovery Add` localStorage fallback if the user navigates away mid-post. Think resilience for accidental refreshes.
4. `Slug-Based Routing` Clean URLs like /blog/building-a-contact-form instead of post IDs. Makes it shareable and more SEO friendly.
5. `Dark Mode Toggle` Quick win with MUI‚Äôs createTheme, and it makes the site feel instantly more modern.
6. `RSS Feed Generation `For your developer audience or followers using Feedly-type tools. Could be auto-built from blog entries.
7. `Author Info / Bio` per Post Even if it‚Äôs just you for now, makes posts feel more personal and gives room to grow if you invite guest posters later.
8. `Fallback 404 Page` Custom ‚ÄúPost Not Found‚Äù page if someone mistypes a URL. You could even make it humorous or stylized.

# Blog page

`Ideas for the blog`
Track progress thru github calendar/projects
Update thoughts/feelings about project + working thru things and learning & philosophy
Include personality type (introspective pattern seeking, emotional) and describe how you set up everything to be the best you can be
Date, description. Scale 1-5 (frown to smile) for how you were feeling before you started, and then again after you're done
In between, have prompts to direct your writings to be more organized/centered/focused

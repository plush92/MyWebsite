//Blog page
//Track progress thru github calendar/projects
//Update thoughts/feelings about project + working thru things and learning & philosophy
//Include personality type (introspective pattern seeking, emotional) and describe how you set up everything to be the best you can be
//Date, description. Scale 1-5 (frown to smile) for how you were feeling before you started, and then again after you're done
//In between, have prompts to direct your writings to be more organized/centered/focused

//create page, navigation links
//create basic blog frontend (you can ignore the github stuff for now, the more complicated, just keep it simple)
//create backend to handle data storage

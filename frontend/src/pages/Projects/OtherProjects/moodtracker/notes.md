# 📅 Weekend Coding Project: Mood Tracker with a Twist

## 🧠 Project Overview

Build a simple web app that lets you log your mood throughout the day. But here's the twist — each mood entry automatically gets paired with something extra: an inspirational quote, a music suggestion, or a beautiful photo.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Flexible)

- **Frontend:** React (perfect for strengthening your React skills)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express _(optional if you want persistence)_
- **Database:** SQLite or Firebase _(optional for storing history)_
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or plain CSS

---

## ✅ Core Features (MVP)

1. **Mood Input**
   - Emoji or dropdown to select current mood (😊 😐 😢 😡 😴)
   - Optional textbox for a note or reflection

2. **Automatic Attachment (The Twist!)**
   - When a mood is saved, pull in one of:
     - A random **inspirational quote** from an API like [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/)
     - A random **Spotify song** suggestion (Spotify API)
     - A random **photo** from Unsplash

3. **Mood History View**
   - View your moods in a list or calendar format
   - Click any entry to see the associated quote/song/photo

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional)

- Add a **mood trend chart** using `Recharts` or `Chart.js`
- **Filter moods** by date or emotion
- Implement **dark mode**
- Allow exporting mood logs as a **CSV file**

## ⏱️ Why It’s a Great Weekend Project

- Combines frontend state management, API fetching, and optional backend work
- You can get an MVP done in a single day
- The app is **actually useful** and can be improved over time

## 💡 Tip

Start with localStorage for storing entries if you want to avoid setting up a backend. You can always upgrade later.

// 52 cards, make a separate file (images for cards?), J Q K = 10, A = 1
// 6 cards to each player, 1 starter card
// each player selects 2 cards for the crib
// players alternate turns placing a card in the center,
// 15 for 2, run for 3, double for 2, trip for 3, go for 1, 31 max before count resets
//have rules displayed at the top
//don't use AI

// Start button, cards for each player, prompt to select 2 for crib, alternating cribs for each turn
// middle game - non crib person places card, other player places card
// score must update depending on card.
// numbered scoring (add board + peg later)
// make frontend first! - two containers to split the p1 p2 hands + middle container for cards + left for 

//1. Pick a card to select dealer (lowest card is dealer)
//2. cards are dealt (non dealer is issued card first, then alternate until 6 are issued to each player)
//3. select 2 cards to send to the crib
//4. non-dealer cuts deck (optional), starter card appears, non-dealer plays card first
//5. dealer issues card, normal play until cards are exhausted
//6. score is counted, crib score is counted, total score is counted, scores are updated. score is automatically counted?
//7. process restarts, game repeats until one playet scores 121
//keep it simple!!!!
